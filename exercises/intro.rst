This section gathers a series of open questions that have been designed to enable the students to improve their understanding of the topics presented in the e-book. These open questions typically contain a small problem that needs to be solved by the student. They are designed so that they can lead to discussions with teaching assistants.

Several `Multiple Choice Questions` and simple exercises are included in the main text and supported by the https://inginious.org platform. 

A good understanding of the topics covered by this e-book can only be obtained by solving the proposed exercises. Reading the e-book from the first to the last page is not sufficient to get a detailed knowledge of computer networking.
